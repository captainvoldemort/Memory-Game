## **Introduction**

This Arduino project is a memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of button presses. The project uses four servos to control colored flags, four LEDs to provide visual feedback, four push buttons for user interaction, and a buzzer for music and sound effects.

## **Materials**

To build the Memory Game project, you'll need the following materials:

- Arduino Uno
- 4 x Servo Motors
- 4 x LEDs (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)
- 4 x 100kÎ© Resistors
- 4 x Push Buttons
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires

## **Installation**

1. Connect the components based on the provided [circuit diagram](https://chat.openai.com/c/06d68d59-2dbc-4a59-b858-95e9723a8b66#circuit-diagram).
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.
3. Power on the Arduino Uno.

## **How to Play**

1. Turn on the Arduino Uno.
2. Wait for the flags to raise and the green LED to start blinking, indicating the start of the game.
3. Press any of the four push buttons to begin the game.
4. Watch the sequence of flag movements and listen to the buzzer tones.
5. Repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons.
6. Continue playing until you win or lose.

## **Game Modes**

- **Memory Game Mode:** Test your memory by repeating increasingly longer sequences of flag movements.
- **Battle Mode:** Challenge a friend in a two-player battle. Each player takes turns adding to the sequence.
- **Bee Gees Mode:** Activate this mode by holding the bottom-right button during power-up to enjoy the Bee Gees song.
